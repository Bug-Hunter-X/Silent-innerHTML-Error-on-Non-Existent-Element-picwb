# Silent innerHTML Error on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug that can be difficult to track down.  The issue involves attempting to modify the `innerHTML` property of an element that doesn't exist in the DOM.  This action typically doesn't throw a JavaScript error, instead silently failing. 

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` presents the corrected version.

## Bug Description
The main problem is the attempt to alter the `innerHTML` of an element with the ID 'nonExistentElement' in the script.  Because this element doesn't exist, the code runs without throwing an obvious error.  However, it doesn't produce any visible change.  This can create scenarios where bugs are harder to debug, as there is no clear error message.

## Solution
The solution focuses on ensuring that the element exists before attempting to modify its `innerHTML`.  Always include robust checks (such as `getElementById` returning a non-null value) to validate element existence prior to manipulation. This will ensure that your code behaves correctly.
